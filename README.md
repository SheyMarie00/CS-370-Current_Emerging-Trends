For my project, I added code for a treasure hunt game. The game has an AI that calculates how to reach treasure. The code I created myself, I was to create the status of the program.The responsibility of a computer scientist is very flexible, depending on the job. But the most common responsibility with all Computer scientists, 
is to make sure that the customers information is protected. Any problem as a computer scientist, I tend to solve with a few considerations in mind. Every problem I have to approach and solve problems with the customer's information and how to be secure from any sort of hacking.
